# Outis Algorithm

The "Outis" is a command-line tool designed for encoding and decoding text using a proprietary encryption method. This tool provides effective way to encode your text securely with a randomly generated key, ensuring that only those with access to the key can decode the text back to its original form.

## Features

- **Encode Text**: Input your text and generate an encoded version using a randomly generated key. Remember, if you lose the key file (`key.zero`), you won't be able to decode the text, so keep it safe!
- **Decode Text**: Decode encoded text using the corresponding key file (`key.zero`). Ensure you have the correct key file to successfully decode the text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation and operation.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled executable file (`Outis.exe`).
3. **Choose an Option**:
   - **Encode Text**: Input the text you want to encode. The program will generate an encoded version of the text and save the key file (`key.zero`) in the same directory.
   - **Decode Text**: Input the encoded text and provide the path to the corresponding key file (`key.zero`). The program will decode the text using the provided key.
   - **Exit**: Quit the program.
4. **Follow On-Screen Prompts**: Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to complete the encoding or decoding process.
5. **Enjoy**: Enjoy using the "Outis" to securely encode and decode your text!
